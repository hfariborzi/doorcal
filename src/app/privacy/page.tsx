      <p>
        {APP_NAME} is a free, open-source scheduling service. People connect their Google Calendar, publish booking
        links, and others use those links to book meetings with them. Hosts can also keep their tasks in{" "}
        {APP_NAME}, have them planned around their calendar, and, if they choose, talk to Dori, an optional
        assistant. This policy explains what data {APP_NAME}{" "}
        collects, how it is used and shared, how it is protected, and how you can delete it. It applies to the
        service at doorcal.com. {APP_NAME} works with Google Calendar and with Microsoft (Outlook, Microsoft 365). Copies of the{" "}
        <a href={SOURCE_URL} target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">open-source code</a> run by other people are separate
        services with their own policies.
      </p>
      <p>
        In this policy, a <strong>host</strong> is someone who signs in with Google and shares booking links, and an{" "}
        <strong>invitee</strong> is someone who books a meeting through a host&apos;s link.
      </p>

      <h2>1. Information we collect</h2>
      <h3>From hosts, through Google or Microsoft sign-in</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Your name, email address, profile picture (Google only) and the provider&apos;s account ID.</li>
        <li>
          An OAuth refresh token that lets {APP_NAME} reach your calendar while you are not on the site, for example
          when someone books you. It is stored encrypted. You can connect several Google and Microsoft accounts; each
          has its own token.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>From hosts, through Google Calendar</h3>
      <p>{APP_NAME} asks for three Google Calendar permissions and uses each one only as described here:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>See your free/busy information</strong> (<code>calendar.freebusy</code>). When someone opens your
          booking page or books a time, we check which times you are busy across the calendars you chose, so nobody
          can book you when you are not free. We only receive busy time ranges, not event details, and we don&apos;t
          store them.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>See the list of your calendars</strong> (<code>calendar.calendarlist.readonly</code>). On the
          Settings page we list your calendars so you can choose which ones count for conflicts and which one new
          bookings go to. We store only the IDs of the calendars you select.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>View and edit events on your calendars</strong> (<code>calendar.events</code>). We use this to
          show your events in your {APP_NAME} dashboard, to create the calendar event (with a Google Meet link for
          online meetings) when someone books you or when you create a meeting in {APP_NAME}, to update it when a
          booking is rescheduled, and to delete it or remove an attendee when a booking is cancelled. We store the ID
          and Google Meet link of events {APP_NAME} creates for bookings. We don&apos;t store the contents of your
          other events; they are fetched when you view your dashboard and not kept.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>From hosts, through Microsoft</h3>
      <p>
        For Microsoft accounts we ask for the <code>Calendars.ReadWrite</code> permission (plus basic profile and
        sign-in permissions) and use it in the same three ways: to find your busy times, to list your calendars, and
        to show, create, update and delete events for the meetings booked with you, with a Microsoft Teams link for
        work and school accounts. Outlook sends the invitations.
      </p>
      <h3>Event categories and AI categorisation (optional)</h3>
      <p>
        You can sort your calendar into categories with your own rules. {APP_NAME} then stores a category and
        priority per event together with a scrambled fingerprint of its title, never the title itself.
      </p>
      {aiConfigured() ? (
        <p>
          If you switch on <strong>AI categorisation</strong> in Settings (it is off until you do), {APP_NAME}{" "}
          sends a minimal description of events that no rule covers to {AI_PROVIDER_NAME} so that a model can
          suggest a category: the event title, its length, whether it repeats, how many attendees it has (not who
          they are), whether it has a video link, and the calendar&apos;s name. Descriptions, attendee names and
          addresses, free/busy data and booking details are never sent, and requests are subject to daily limits
          per user and for the whole service.{AI_MODEL ? ` The model currently used is ${AI_MODEL}.` : ""} The provider processes this only to answer the request
          and does not use it to train or improve AI models: under OpenAI&apos;s API terms, data sent to the API is
          not used for training and is retained for at most 30 days for abuse monitoring; OpenRouter is
          instructed, on every request, to route only to OpenAI or to Microsoft&apos;s Azure OpenAI Service (which
          hosts the same models under the same no-training terms) and only to providers that do not store or
          train on data. In our OpenRouter account, zero data retention is enforced for OpenAI models, so requests
          are served only by endpoints that do not store them; routing to providers that may train on data is
          disabled; and prompt logging is switched off. {APP_NAME}{" "}
          itself keeps only the resulting category label. You can switch this off at any time, which also deletes
          the AI-suggested labels.
        </p>
      ) : (
        <p>AI categorisation is not enabled on this instance; no event data is sent to any AI provider.</p>
      )}
      <h3>Tasks and planning</h3>
      <p>
        If you use Tasks, {APP_NAME} stores what you enter: your areas, projects and tasks, with their notes, due
        dates, estimates, priorities, links between tasks, and the names of people you type in. {APP_NAME} then
        plans your open tasks into free time around your calendar. The planning is done by {APP_NAME}&apos;s own
        code, not by an AI model; it uses the busy times from the calendars you chose for conflicts, and stores
        only the resulting planned times and which task each belongs to, not the details of your events.
      </p>
      <p>
        To keep the plan current, {APP_NAME} asks Google and Microsoft to notify it when events change on those
        calendars. A notification says only that something changed, not what; {APP_NAME} then reads your busy
        times again and moves planned work if needed. Planned work stays in {APP_NAME} and is never written to
        your calendar unless you add it yourself.
      </p>
      <h3>Dori, the assistant (optional)</h3>
      {aiConfigured() ? (
        <>
          <p>
            Dori is off until you turn her on. When you message her, {APP_NAME} sends {AI_PROVIDER_NAME} what she
            needs to answer: your message and your recent conversation with her; your areas, projects and tasks
            (titles, notes, dates, estimates, priorities and the names of people you typed); notes she keeps for
            you, such as &ldquo;not in the mood for writing today&rdquo;; your working hours and planned work; and,
            from your calendars for the coming week (or a range you ask about), each event&apos;s title, start and
            end time, calendar name and number of attendees. Attendee names and email addresses, event
            descriptions and locations are never sent.{DORI_MODEL ? ` The model currently used is ${DORI_MODEL}.` : ""}{" "}
            The same no-training and zero-data-retention setup described above for AI categorisation applies, and
            requests are subject to daily limits per user and for the whole service.
          </p>
          <p>
            Dori can add, change, complete and remove your tasks and projects, and every change she makes can be
            undone. She never moves or deletes calendar events. She can offer to add an event to your calendar,
            which happens only when you press <strong>Add to calendar</strong>, and she can prepare emails, which
            open in your own mail app with the recipients filled in by {APP_NAME} in your browser; {APP_NAME} never
            sends them. Your conversation with Dori is stored in {APP_NAME} until you clear it or turn Dori off,
            which also deletes the notes she kept.
          </p>
          <p>
            {VOICE
              ? `If you talk to Dori with the microphone, your recording is sent through OpenRouter to ElevenLabs to be turned into text; only the text is kept, as your message. If you have Dori read an answer aloud, the text of that answer is sent the same way to be turned into speech. Both requests are restricted to endpoints that keep no data (zero data retention) and do not use it for training, and ${APP_NAME} stores neither recordings nor audio.`
              : "Voice input, where available, uses your browser's own speech recognition, and reading answers aloud uses your browser's built-in voices."}

        <p>Dori is not enabled on this instance; no task or calendar data is sent to any AI provider.</p>

      <h3>Settings hosts create</h3>
      <p>
        Your username, display name, headline, welcome message, time zone, availability schedules and event types,
        including any questions you ask invitees.
      </p>
      <h3>From invitees</h3>
      <p>
        When you book a meeting we collect the details you enter: your name, email address, any guest email
        addresses, a phone number if the meeting is a phone call, your answers to the host&apos;s questions, your
        notes, and your time zone. Invitees don&apos;t need an account and we don&apos;t access invitees&apos;
        calendars.

      <h3>Technical information</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Cookies: a session cookie that keeps hosts signed in (30 days) and a short-lived cookie used during Google
          sign-in (10 minutes). We don&apos;t use analytics, advertising or tracking cookies.
        </li>
        <li>
          IP addresses, used to limit abuse of booking pages. We store only a one-way hash of your IP address in

      <h2>2. How we use information</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>To provide scheduling: show availability, take bookings, and create, update and cancel calendar events.</li>
        <li>To show hosts their calendar, bookings and settings in the dashboard.</li>
        <li>To keep hosts&apos; tasks, plan them around their calendar, and, if they turn it on, let Dori answer and act on their requests.</li>
        <li>To let invitees view, reschedule or cancel their own booking.</li>
        <li>To keep the service secure and working, including preventing spam and abuse.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>We don&apos;t use your data for advertising, we don&apos;t sell it, and we don&apos;t build profiles of you.</p>

      <h2>3. Google user data and Limited Use</h2>
      <p>
        {APP_NAME}&apos;s use and transfer to any other app of information received from Google APIs will adhere to{" "}
        <a href="https://developers.google.com/terms/api-services-user-data-policy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">
          Google API Services User Data Policy
        </a>
        , including the Limited Use requirements.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>We use Google user data only to provide and improve the scheduling features you use.</li>
        <li>We don&apos;t transfer it to others except as needed to provide the service, to comply with law, or as part of a merger or acquisition with notice to you.</li>
        <li>We don&apos;t use it for advertising, including retargeting, personalized or interest-based ads.</li>
        <li>We don&apos;t sell it, and we don&apos;t use it to train or improve generalized AI or machine-learning models.</li>
        <li>
          No person reads your Google data unless you ask us to (for example for support), it is needed for
          security or to investigate abuse, or the law requires it.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>4. How information is shared</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Between host and invitee.</strong> When an invitee books, the host sees the details the invitee
          entered, and both see the meeting details. These details are written into the host&apos;s Google Calendar
          event, and Google sends the invitation and any updates to the invitee and their guests.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Service providers</strong> that run {APP_NAME} for us and may process data only on our
          instructions: Vercel (hosting) and Neon (database). Data may be processed in the United States and other
          countries where these providers operate.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Google and Microsoft</strong>, to read and update your calendars as described above.</li>
        {aiConfigured() && (
          <li>
            <strong>The AI provider</strong> ({AI_PROVIDER_NAME}), only if you turn on AI categorisation or Dori, and
            only what is described above. It may not use the data to train or improve AI models.
          </li>
        )}
        {VOICE && (
          <li>
            <strong>ElevenLabs</strong>, through OpenRouter, only for Dori&apos;s voice: recordings you make with her
            microphone and answers you ask her to read aloud, on zero-data-retention endpoints.
          </li>
        )}
        <li><strong>When required by law</strong>, or to protect the rights, safety and security of users and the service.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>We don&apos;t sell or rent personal information to anyone.</p>

      <h2>5. How information is protected</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>All traffic to {APP_NAME} is encrypted with HTTPS.</li>
        <li>Refresh tokens are encrypted at rest with AES-256-GCM. Access tokens are kept only in memory, briefly.</li>
        <li>
          A host&apos;s dashboard, calendar and bookings are available only to that host after signing in. A
          host&apos;s public profile and event types are visible to anyone with the link, by design. Invitees can
          reach only their own booking, through its private link.
        </li>
        <li>Our database provider encrypts stored data, and access to production systems is limited to the operator.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>No system is perfectly secure, but we work to protect your data and will notify affected users of a breach as required by law.</p>

      <h2>6. How long we keep data, and how to delete it</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Hosts:</strong> your data is kept while your account exists. You can delete your account at any
          time in <strong>Settings → Delete account</strong>. This immediately deletes your profile, settings, event
          types, schedules, tasks, plan, conversation with Dori and booking history from our database and revokes
          {" "}{APP_NAME}&apos;s access to your Google accounts. Calendar events already on your calendars stay
          there, under your control.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Removing a connected account</strong> (Settings → Connected calendars → Remove) deletes its stored
          token and, for Google, revokes {APP_NAME}&apos;s access. Microsoft doesn&apos;t let apps revoke their own
          access, so also remove {APP_NAME} at{" "}
          <a href="https://account.microsoft.com/privacy/app-access" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">account.microsoft.com/privacy/app-access</a>{" "}
          (personal accounts) or <a href="https://myapps.microsoft.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">myapps.microsoft.com</a>{" "}
          (work and school accounts). Google access can also be revoked at{" "}
          <a href="https://myaccount.google.com/permissions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">myaccount.google.com/permissions</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Invitees:</strong> booking details are kept as part of the host&apos;s booking history until the
          host deletes their account, or until you ask us to delete them.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Tasks and Dori:</strong> tasks and projects are kept until you delete them. Your conversation with
          Dori is kept until you clear it or turn Dori off. The plan is recomputed and overwritten as things change.
        </li>
        <li>Deleted data may remain in our database provider&apos;s backups for a short period (up to about 30 days) before it is overwritten.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>7. Your choices and rights</h2>
      <p>
        You can see and change your data in the dashboard, and delete it as described above. You can also ask us to
        access, correct, export or delete your personal information, including booking details you entered as an
        invitee, by contacting us. Depending on where you live, you may have further rights under privacy laws such
        as PIPEDA, the GDPR or US state laws, and you may complain to your data protection authority.
      </p>

      <h2>8. Children</h2>
      <p>
        {APP_NAME} is not directed to children under 13 and we don&apos;t knowingly collect their personal
        information. If you believe a child has given us information, contact us and we will delete it.
      </p>

      <h2>9. Changes to this policy</h2>
      <p>
        We will post any changes on this page and update the date above. If a change materially affects how we use
        Google user data or other personal information, we will tell hosts by email before it takes effect.
